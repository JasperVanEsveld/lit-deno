# Contributing to lit-deno

Unfortunately, to to restraints in internal tooling and open source licencing
requirements, lit-deno does not accept contributions of any kind for two
reasons:

1. A contribution to lit-deno would be tantamount to a contribution in the
   origin Lit repository. This would cause a deviation in repositories.

2. Lit is developed in typescript. Lit-deno is a shallow shim of the original
   Lit and will never be anything more.

Lit-Deno represents the minimal amount of changes it takes to run Lit in Deno.

This should not discourage developers from contributing to the original Lit
repository. However, contributing to the original Lit repo assumes you are
developing in NodeJS.
