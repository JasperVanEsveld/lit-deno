# Contributing to lit-deno

Lit-Deno will not accept contributions for two reason:

1. A contribution to lit-deno would be tantamount to a contribution in the
   original Lit repository. This would cause a deviation in repositories.

2. Lit-deno is a shallow shim of the original Lit and will never be anything
   more.

Lit-Deno represents the minimal amount of changes it takes to run Lit in Deno.

This should not discourage developers from contributing to the original Lit
repository. However, contributing to the original Lit repo assumes you are
developing in NodeJS.

Do not post Lit-Deno issues in the original Lit repository. Instead, post
Lit-Deno issues [here](https://github.com/taylor-vann/lit-deno/issues).
